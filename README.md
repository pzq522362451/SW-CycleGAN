# SW-CycleGAN
Cycle consistency generative adversarial networks with Sliced Wasserstein distance

-  Tensorflow 2.X implementation
-  Inspired by Deshpande $et$ $al$. [sliced Wassetstein generator] (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Deshpande_Generative_Modeling_Using_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf), the sliced wasserstein distance (SWD) gains less computation and fast convergence than Wasserstein distance (WD). The code for SWD is shown in (https://github.com/ishansd/swg).
-  This repository contains reprodce of several experiments mentioned in the paper
-  Both unconditional and conditional SW-CycleGAN were verified with the MNIST handwritting dataset.
-  The implementation for CycleGAN using the MNIST dataset is shown in (https://github.com/MorvanZhou/mnistGANs)
